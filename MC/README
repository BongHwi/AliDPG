*     MC - Monte Carlo simulation central production
*******************************************************

This set of macros and scripts are meant to steer and
configure centralised productions of Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation events for the needs of the ALICE experiment
at the LHC. The documentation is and will be scarse as
the task of configuring, validating and running MC
simulations centrally for ALICE is perfomed by the
experts and with the supervision and agreement of the
DPG group. Nonetheless, here is a minumal information
of how MC productions are handled by this framework and
how the several files interrelate one to another.
